\title{Niche overlap}

\description{
Compute niche overlap from predictions of species distributions with the I similarity statistic of Warren et al. (2009). The statistic ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (the distributions are identical).
}

\usage{ nicheOverlap(x,y, mask=TRUE, checkNegatives=TRUE) }

\arguments{
\item{x}{RasterLayer with non-negative values (predictions of the probability that a site is suitable for a species)}
\item{y}{RasterLayer with non-negative values, as above}
\item{mask}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the function removes cells from \code{x} that are \code{NA} in \code{y} and vice-versa. If you are sure that such cases do not occur you can set this to \code{FALSE} to speed up computations}
\item{checkNegatives}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the function checks of any of the values in \code{x} and \code{y} are negative. If you are sure that such cases do not occur you can set this to \code{FALSE} to speed up computations}
