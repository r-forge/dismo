\title{Pair-wise distance sampling}

\description{
Select pairs of points from two sets (without replacement) that have a similar distance to their nearest point in another set of points. 

For each point in "\code{fixed}", a point is selected from "\code{sample}" that has a similar distance (as defined by \code{threshold}) to its nearest point in "\code{reference}" (note that these are likely to be different points in \code{reference}). The select point is either the nearest point \code{nearest=TRUE}, or a randomly select point \code{nearest=FALSE} that is within the threshold distance. If no point within the threshold distance is found in \code{sample}, the point in \code{fixed} is dropped.

Hijmans (2012) proposed this sampling approach to remove 'spatial sorting bias' (\code{\link{ssb}}) from evaluation data used in cross-validation of presence-only species distribution models. In that context, \code{fixed} are the testing-presence points, \code{sample} the testing-absence (or testing-background) points, and \code{reference} the training-presence points.

\usage{
pwdSample(fixed, sample, reference, tr=0.33, nearest=TRUE, n=1, lonlat=TRUE, warn=TRUE) 
}
 
\arguments{
  \item{fixed}{two column matrix (x, y) or (longitude/latitude) or SpatialPoints object, for point locations for which a pair should be found in \code{sample} }
  \item{sample}{as above for point locations from which to sample to make a pair with a point from \code{fixed}}
  \item{reference}{as above for reference point locations to which distances are computed}
  \item{n}{How many pairs do you want for each point in \code{fixed}}
  \item{tr}{Numeric, normally below 1. The threshold distance for a pair of points (one of \code{fixed} and one of \code{sample}) to their respective nearest points in \code{reference} to be considered a valid pair. The absolute difference in distance between the candidate point pairs in \code{fixed} and \code{reference} (dfr) and the distance between candidate point pairs in \code{sample} and \code{reference} (dsr) must be smaller than \code{tr} * dfr. I.e. if the dfr = 100 km, and tr = 0.1, dsr must be between >90 and <110 km to be considered a valid pair.}
  \item{nearest}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the pair with the smallest difference in distance to their nearest \code{reference} point is selected. If \code{FALSE}, a random point from the valid pairs (with a difference in distance below the threshold defined by \code{tr}) is selected (generally leading to higher \code{\link{ssb})}}
  \item{lonlat}{ Logical. Use \code{TRUE} if the coordinates are spherical (in degrees), and use \code{FALSE} if they are planar }
  \item{warn}{ Logical. If \code{TRUE} a warning is given if \code{nrow(fixed) < nrow(sample)} }
}

\value{
A matrix of nrow(fixed) and ncol(n), that indicates, for each point (row) in \code{fixed} which point(s) in \code{sample} it is paired to; or \code{NA} if no suitable pair was available.
