\title{Australian Wet Tropics species distribution data}

\description{
Species occurence data for 40 species (20 plants, 20 birds) in the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT) and associated environmental data. There are three data sets with training (AWTtrain), background (AWTbackground), and test (AWTtest) data. The training data principally consist of environmental variables at locations where the species where observed (presence only), and at random locations for background data. The test data are presence/absence observations of the same species, independent from the training data.


The reference system of the x and y coordinates is UTM, zone 55, spheroid grs1980, datum GDA94

Plant species records from Andrew Ford and Karen Richardson. Training data is from herbariums. These data have been cleaned and corrected by Andrew Ford for modeling by the Rainforest CRC, Townsville.  Most records are thought to be accurate to within 3 km, and were collected within the last 40 years. Presence-absence from 102 of Andrew Ford's survey sites. These have very accurate coordinate data and were collected in the last 20 years. Vertebrate data was collected by Steve Williams. Training data is from incidental surveys using GPS. Presence-absence data from field surveys.
